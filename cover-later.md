Hiring Manager
MargMaker Solutions
Nagpur, Maharashtra

Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Web Developer position at your company. With a solid background in front-end and back-end development, I bring hands-on experience in ReactJS, Node.js, and game development using Phaser.js. Currently, I’m working as a Full Stack Developer at MindYourLogic, where I’ve contributed to building web puzzle games, optimized testing processes, and developed cross-platform miniGame apps.

One of my key projects includes building a robust backend for a video streaming website, where I implemented user features like authentication, subscriptions, and video interactions. I also created a responsive portfolio site for photographers using React and TailwindCSS, focusing on user experience and design.

I enjoy solving problems through code and am always eager to learn and improve. My goal is to build scalable and user-friendly applications that make a real impact.

I’d love the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team.

Sincerely,
Atharva Shankar Awari
